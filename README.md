## Aim

The aim of the project is to deploy a Prognostics(predicting time of failure)
model which not only takes into account the statistical methods of predicting
the lifetime and optimum maintenance time frame of machinery, but also
takes into account real-time operation history from thousands of cycles of
operation. Predictions made using a trained Neural Network on sensor data
are known to be more accurate, with a focus placed on raw events data
allowing for reliable estimates in tandem with Probabilistic approaches.


The final model will be a hybrid of raw sensor-based trained Neural network
and probabilistic models that have been conventionally used, thereby
allowing for an interaction between a number of factors that are otherwise
neglected.
